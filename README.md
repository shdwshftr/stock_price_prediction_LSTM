# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM (GOOGL & INTC)

## About
This repository contains a project for Deep Learning Final Exam (4th Semester). The goal is to build a LSTM model to predict stock price (GOOGL & INTC).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is given by the lecturer team which contains the historic daily stock prices for some stocks in the technology sector. The data is taken from Yahoo Finance through “yfinance” Python package
and contains the stock prices until 01 April 2020. While there are 8 stocks inside the dataset, the lecturer team only asked the students to take 2 stocks data according to the gender and student ID, with that, the stock data
for me are GOOGL Alphabet Inc and INTC Intel Corporation.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Understanding
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Modeling
4. Evaluation
